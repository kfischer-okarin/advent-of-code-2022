# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written in
[DragonRuby GTK](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk).

## How to checkout the game
1. Extract the DragonRuby version you want to use somewhere
2. Delete original `mygame` folder (or alternatively rename it into `mygame-template` if you want to keep the files around)
3. Clone your game (this repository) via git
4. Copy the DragonRuby engine into your game repository (don't forget the hidden `.dragonruby` folder)
